    "Pros:\n",
    "- Easy to share your work via their website.\n",
    "- Very easy to create dashboards.\n",
    "- Useful when we want to do something quick, simple and good looking.\n",
    "- Open source and active development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Not very customisable.\n",
    "- Good for small to medium project, but it's hard to make it work for big projects.\n",
